# Lua Compiler

Welcome to the Lua Compiler project, a comprehensive Lua compiler built with Lua. This project is a collaborative effort led by Luna, with significant contributions from Evan, guys from LGHCWare, and others.

## üéØ About

The Lua Compiler project is an ambitious endeavor to create a robust and flexible Lua compiler using Lua itself. The project aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for working with Lua code, from compilation and interpretation to beautification and optimization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

The project is built from scratch without any third-party libraries. All modules are developed by Luna, Evan, and the team at LGHCWare. The project is still under development, and features may change over time. Current features include:

- **Pseudo-Assembler for Lua Bytecode:** A tool for assembling Lua bytecode.
- **Interpreter:** A near-complete interpreter featuring a tokenizer, parser, and math parser.
- **Flexible Virtual Machine:** A virtual machine designed for flexibility and ease of use.
- **Code Beautifier and Minifier:** Tools for making your Lua code as readable or as compact as you need.
- **Optimizer:** An optimizer for improving the performance of your Lua code (currently under development).
- **ASTExecutor and Obfuscator:** Tools for executing abstract syntax trees and obfuscating code.
- **Class Debugger:** A debugging tool specifically designed for classes.
- **Helpers Library:** A library of helper functions and utilities.
- **ASTHierarchy Module:** A module for better AST navigation.
- **LEGACY Tools:** Legacy versions of our Decompiler, Static Analyzer, Instruction Generator.

You can find some examples how to use different modules in the `/Examples` directory.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

We have big plans for the future of the Lua Compiler project:

**Improvements:**

- Interpreter
- Decompiler
- Static Analyzer
- Instruction Generator

**New Features:**

- Deobfuscator
- Code profiler
- Code smell detector
- Luau-Lua transpiler
- Lua 5.2+ syntax support
- VM-based Full-Code Obfuscator
- Logic-based Full-Code Obfuscator

## Getting Started

To run the code, you need to install Lua 5.1 or higher.

## ‚ùì Mini Q&A

**What is the purpose of this project?**

This project aims to transform/compile Lua(u) code of any version. It started as a hobby but has potential for future expansion.
