# Graveyard of Ideas
Welcome to the Graveyard of Ideas. This is where I put all the ideas that was proven to be bad or not worth pursuing. If you think you can make something out of these ideas, feel free to do so, but I will not be working on them anymore.

## Ideas

**1. AST Transformer**: This sub-module was supposed to be a part of this project, I tried implementing it two times, but it was too hard to do, and it didn't have any practical use or benefits. I decided to completely remove it from the project. The code is still in the `/legacy` folder, if you want to take a look at it.
**2. A generator of parsers**: This tool was supposed to make the process of crafting my Lua parsers easier - just by providing it a single file, it would generate a parser for it. I failed implementing it, because it had a lot of edge cases, and it was too hard to do. For now, I will be writing the parsers manually.
**3. A UNIT testing framework**: Since I like testing my code, I wanted to make a testing framework for this project which would take data Lua files, and build tests from them, it was too bug, and I decided to pretty much abandon it (for now).
